   - Factory functions for different execution environments

## Technical Features

### Runner Interface
All runners implement the standard interface:
```python
def execute_artifact(artifact, env_vars, timeout) → ExecutionResult
def validate_environment() → bool
def cleanup() → None
def get_capabilities() → Dict[str, Any]
```

#### 5. Kubernetes Job Execution
- **Use Case**: Cloud-native execution, scalable workloads
- **Features**: Job management, resource limits, service accounts
- **Security**: Kubernetes RBAC, network policies
- **Performance**: Cluster-based scaling

### Configuration System

Each runner type has dedicated configuration classes:

```python
@dataclass
class DockerConfig(RunnerConfig):
    image: str = "ubuntu:latest"
    pull_policy: str = "if-not-present"
    volumes: Dict[str, str] = field(default_factory=dict)
    ports: Dict[int, int] = field(default_factory=dict)
    # ... additional Docker-specific options
```

### Integration with Executor

The enhanced `ArtifactExecutor` now supports:
- Automatic runner selection based on execution context
- Manual runner specification
- Comprehensive validation and security checks
- Detailed execution result tracking

## Usage Examples

### 1. Local Development
```python
from clockwork.forge.executor import create_development_executor

executor = create_development_executor("local")
results = executor.execute_bundle(bundle)
```

### 2. Containerized Execution
```python
from clockwork.forge.executor import create_secure_executor

executor = create_secure_executor("docker", {
    "runner_config": {"image": "python:3.12-slim"}
})
results = executor.execute_bundle(bundle)
```

### 3. Remote Deployment
```python
from clockwork.forge.executor import create_executor_for_environment

executor = create_executor_for_environment("ssh", {
    "hostname": "deploy.example.com",
    "username": "deployer"
})
results = executor.execute_bundle(bundle)
```

### 4. Kubernetes Jobs
```python
executor = create_executor_for_environment("kubernetes", {
    "namespace": "production",
    "image": "myapp:latest"
})
results = executor.execute_bundle(bundle)
```

## Security Features

### Path Validation
- All artifact paths validated against build directory
- Protection against directory traversal attacks
- Symbolic link restrictions

### Content Security
- Pattern-based detection of dangerous code
- Language-specific security checks
- Configurable security policies

### Environment Isolation
- Container-based isolation for Docker/Podman/Kubernetes
- Process-level isolation for local execution
- Network isolation options

### Resource Management
- Memory and CPU limits
- Process count restrictions
- File descriptor limits
- Execution timeouts

## Testing and Validation

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Local runner execution with UV
- ✅ Runner factory functionality
- ✅ Automatic runner selection
- ✅ Executor integration
- ✅ Error handling and recovery
- ✅ Configuration validation

### Environment Detection
The system automatically detects available execution environments:
- Local execution (always available)
- Docker (if daemon accessible)
- Podman (if available)
- SSH (if client installed)
- Kubernetes (if kubectl available)

## Performance Characteristics

### Local Runner
- **Startup Time**: Minimal (~0.02s)
- **Resource Overhead**: Low
- **Isolation**: Process-level only

### Container Runners (Docker/Podman)
- **Startup Time**: Moderate (image pulling)
- **Resource Overhead**: Container overhead
- **Isolation**: Full container isolation

### SSH Runner
- **Startup Time**: Network-dependent
- **Resource Overhead**: Network transfer
- **Isolation**: Remote system isolation
