In code we speak, the servers sing,  
A quiet hum of machines,  
Their purpose clear, their paths defined –  
Declarative lines, the path we bind.

No endless scripts of steps to trace,  
Just what we want, the state we place.  
From skeleton to full stack, the plan unfolds,  
In tidy, readable syntax, the future molds.

Infrastructure, like a garden, grows with care,  
Each resource a seed, each config a prayer.  
The beauty lies in the promise made,  
“Await the end, and all shall be arrayed.”

Automation hums, a steady pulse,  
Detection, scaling, a fearless suss.  
With every line, a harmony,  
The chaos fades, the system glows in symmetry.

So let us write in declarative grace,  
Where intention meets the machine,  
And watch the world of servers bloom—  
A symphony of order, forever tuned.
