## 🏗️ Integration Achievements

### 1. Enhanced ClockworkCore API
```python
# Complete pipeline with all enhancements
core = ClockworkCore(config_path=Path("."), runner_type="docker")

# Enhanced intake with dependency resolution
ir = core.intake(path=Path("config/"), resolve_deps=True)

# Assembly with state diffing
action_list = core.assembly(ir)

# Forge with multi-runner support
execution_context = {"runner_type": "docker", "requires_isolation": True}
results = core.apply(path=Path("config/"), execution_context=execution_context)

# Daemon operations
daemon = core.start_daemon()
drift_report = core.detect_drift()
core.remediate_drift(Path("config/"))
```

### 2. Comprehensive Error System
- **33 Error Types**: Complete error hierarchy for all components
- **Contextual Errors**: File paths, line numbers, component information
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Helpful suggestions and guidance
- **Error Chaining**: Proper causation tracking

### 3. Multi-Environment Execution
- **5 Runner Types**: Local, Docker, Podman, SSH, Kubernetes
- **Automatic Selection**: Context-based runner selection
- **Environment Validation**: Pre-execution checks
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: Automatic fallback mechanisms

### 4. Advanced Dependency Management
- **Multi-Source Resolution**: Git, local, registry sources
- **Version Constraints**: Semantic versioning
- **Intelligent Caching**: Efficient dependency caching
- **Offline Capability**: Works with cached dependencies

## 🔍 Architecture Verification

### Three-Phase Pipeline ✅
```
Intake (Parser + Validator + Resolver) 
    ↓
Assembly (Planner + Differ + Dependencies)
    ↓ 
Forge (Compiler + Executor + Runner + State)
```

### Infrastructure Components ✅
- **Daemon**: Continuous monitoring and drift detection
- **Error System**: Centralized error handling
- **Cache Management**: Dependency and state caching
- **Runner System**: Multi-environment execution

### Data Flow ✅
```
.cw files → IR → ActionList → ArtifactBundle → Results
    ↓           ↓         ↓           ↓
EnvFacts → StateDiff → Artifacts → StateUpdate
```
